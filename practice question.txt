Actions to be performed

Expected Result

1

Launch the application

Application is launched

2

Enter the following data

Click on 'Click on me' to enter the name link and handle the pop up

Test data: John

Pass the name from excel in the popup

The show bill displays the platform details and the ordered purchase.

 

Validation rules:

All the fields are mandatory

All the input fields are numeric

 

Following are the java classes that contains code snippets.

 

DriverSetup.java

Create driver (complete implementation is given for you)

Emicalculator.java

Create the Page object model and required methods for valid scenario

ExcelUtils.java

Create readExcelData(String sheet Name) to read the test data from excel

TestEmiCalculator.java

Get the data from excel and Pass on to the input fields

 

Procedure to complete the case study

1.   class DriverSetup is completely implemented for your reference. This class is configured to test using Firefox browser and Firefox driver.

a)   Use the method 'getDriver' to create a driver wherever required.

b)   DO NOT CHANGE THIS CLASS

 

2. Class named EmiCalculator.java is already available in template code.

Hint : Do NOT remove the existing code.

 Create PageObjectModel for the required webelements

Method Name

Description

public void setName(String name)
handle the popup and send text using sendkeys with 'name'
public void setAmount(String amt)

locate and fill the input box of the 'Amount' with 'amt'

public void setYear (String yrs)

public void setAlert()

 

Handle the alert once the calculate button is clicked

public String getEmiAmount()

locate the calculated amount message and return the text

.

3. Class named ExcelUtils.java is already available in template code.

Hint : Do NOT remove the existing code.

public static String[] readExcelData(String sheetName)

Using the sheet name passed to this method, read the data and store it in a string array

 



4. Class named TestEmiCalculator.java is already available in template code.

Hint : Do NOT remove the existing code.

 public void setUp()

Create the driver using method 'getDriver' in class DriverSetup.

Assign it to the variable 'driver'

public static String[] getExcelData()

Call the method 'readExcelData' in class 'ExcelUtils' using sheet name emi_valid

public void testValidEmiCalculator(String[] data)

call the method required  in class 'EmiCalculator' and pass the excel data

print the output in console

public void closeBrowser

close the browser

main.java

create the object and call the required methods
